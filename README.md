# 🚗 Vehicle Detection in Adverse Weather Using Computer Vision

This project implements a real-time vehicle detection pipeline for foggy and low-visibility conditions using a combination of classical and deep learning computer vision techniques. The system is optimized for static camera environments such as traffic monitoring or security surveillance and produces annotated output as video frames or a GIF.

## 🎯 Objective

To detect and localize **moving vehicles in foggy conditions** by enhancing contrast, applying semantic segmentation, and filtering background motion — all without any supervised training.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ **Fog Enhancement** using CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)
- ✅ **Semantic Segmentation** using DeepLabV3 with ResNet101 (PyTorch)
- ✅ **Motion Detection** using OpenCV’s MOG2 background subtractor
- ✅ **Contour Filtering & Bounding Boxes** for object localization
- ✅ **Optimized Processing** with frame skipping and resolution resizing
- ✅ **GIF Export** for visualizing results

## 🧠 Pipeline Overview

1. **Frame Preprocessing**
   - Apply CLAHE to enhance contrast in foggy scenes.
   - Resize frames for efficient segmentation.

2. **Semantic Segmentation**
   - Use DeepLabV3 to extract vehicle-relevant pixels (car, bus, truck).

3. **Background Subtraction**
   - Apply MOG2 subtractor to isolate moving regions.
   - Threshold and morphologically filter foreground mask.

4. **Mask Fusion**
   - Combine segmentation mask and motion mask to extract only **moving vehicles**.

5. **Object Detection**
   - Filter small blobs.
   - Draw bounding boxes around valid vehicle contours.
